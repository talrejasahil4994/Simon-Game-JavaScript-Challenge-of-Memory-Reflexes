---# Simon-Game-JavaScript-Challenge-of-Memory-Reflexes
This is an interactive memory-based game built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Players must follow an expanding sequence of colored button presses, testing their focus and pattern recall. Each correct input unlocks the next level — but one wrong click resets the game.
